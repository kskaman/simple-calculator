## Project Overview

This app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A major focus of this project was implementing a **multiple theme toggle** for the calculator interface, giving users an option to switch between different themes.

## Features

### Calculator Functionality:

- Perform basic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Clear and intuitive interface for entering numbers and operations.

### Multiple Themes:

- Toggle between three predefined themes for the calculator.
- Dynamically updates colors and styles based on the selected theme.

### Responsive Design:

- Optimized layout for both desktop and mobile screens.

## Practice Goals

- Strengthen React component structure and state management.
- Practice TypeScript by implementing typed props, state, and logic.
- Explore the implementation of multiple themes using context and CSS custom properties.
- Enhance UI design and responsiveness with CSS Modules.

## Tools and Technologies

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and maintain code quality.
- **CSS Modules**: For styling the components with modular and scoped CSS.
- **Vite**: For a fast and efficient development environment.

## User Instructions

### Features for Users:

- Perform basic arithmetic calculations by entering numbers and operations.
- Switch between three different themes to personalize the calculator's appearance.
